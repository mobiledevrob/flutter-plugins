## 0.2.0

* Updated dependencies
* **Breaking Change**: You need to add a maven section with the "https://maven.google.com" endpoint to the repository section of your `android/build.gradle`. For example:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven {                              // NEW
            url "https://maven.google.com"   // NEW
        }                                    // NEW
    }
}
```
